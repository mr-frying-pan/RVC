# RISC-V compiler, disassembler and interpreter

I am using my own executable format. Not following any ideology, workflow or anything like that, this is mostly just
to learn C++.

## Instruction sets

RV32I is in progress. Others may happen later.

## Executable format

Will exactly define this when I'll reach executable creation step.
