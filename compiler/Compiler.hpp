/**
 * Compiles instruction into machine code.

 * Does not do linking â€“ if instruction has a label parameter it will
 * not be checked if it is defined, and will not be included in the
 * resulting instruction. This will have to be done by linker.
 *
 * @param node    parsed and checked assemblly instruction
 * @returns       compiled instruction and (optionally) a label referenced in it.
 *                If label is not referenced, then empty string is returned in its place.
 *                If instruction is a label itself, then Instruction::zero is produced as first member.
